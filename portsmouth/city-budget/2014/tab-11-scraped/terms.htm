<ul>
  <li><span class="section-number">25.1</span> by our terms and conditions RSS feed at <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/template/termsfeed.rss">https://scraperwiki.com/template/termsfeed.rss</a>; and</li>
  <li><span class="section-number">25.2</span> when you log in for the first time after the announcement</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="section-number">26</span> The announcement will give a date on which the new terms will come into effect. Except in situations forced on us by unexpected changes in the law, we will always give at least one month's notice of any change.</p>
<p><span class="section-number">27</span> If you are using our free pricing plan, your continued use of our services indicates your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
<p><span class="section-number">28</span> If you are using any other pricing plan and we have announced changes to our terms and conditions, you may terminate your contract with us by giving us notice in writing within 21 days of the date on which the announcement was made.  Under these circumstances, your right of access to <em>the platform</em> will terminate on the date the new terms and conditions come into force.
