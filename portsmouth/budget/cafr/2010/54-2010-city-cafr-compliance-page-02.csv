"compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the "
"effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness "

"A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow "
"management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and "
"correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A "
"material weakness in internal control over compliance is deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal "
"control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance "
"requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. "
"Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the preceding "
"paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be "
"deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal "
"control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. "
