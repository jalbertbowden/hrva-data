"(1)Personal property taxes are assessed on property owned as of January 1 and become due June 5th of each year.  Because the due date falls so "
"near the last day of the fiscal year, there is normally a substantial amount of delinquent taxes receivable as of the close of the fiscal year, the majority "
"of which is collected in the following fiscal year."
