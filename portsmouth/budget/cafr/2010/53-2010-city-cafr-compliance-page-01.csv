"REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON "
"COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL "
"STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH "
"GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS "
"Honorable Mayor and Members of City Council  "
"City of Portsmouth, Virginia "
"We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the "
"aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund information "
"of the City of Portsmouth, Virginia (City), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010, which collectively "
"comprise the City’s basic financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated November 22, 2010. We "
"conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, "
"the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the "
"Comptroller General of the United States, and the Specifications for Audits of Counties, Cities, and Towns, issued "
"by the Auditor of Public Accounts of the Commonwealth of Virginia. "
"Internal Control Over Financial Reporting "
"In planning and performing our audit, we considered the City's internal control over financial reporting as a basis "

"financial reporting. "
"A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or "

"control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements "
"will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  "
"Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first "
"paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial "
"reporting that might be deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. We did not identify any "
"deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined "
"above. "
"Compliance and Other Matters "
"As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the City's basic financial statements are free of material "
