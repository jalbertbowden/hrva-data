Budget Overview



Introduction


The City of Portsmouth was settled in 1752 and incorporated by the Virginia General

Assembly in 1858. The City lies in Hampton Roads, one of the world’s great natural harbors, situated at the confluence of the James and Elizabeth Rivers where they empty into the

Chesapeake Bay. The City is located in the center of the Hampton Roads region, bordered by the cities of Suffolk, and Chesapeake, respectively to the West and south, and Norfolk lies across the Elizabeth River to the East. The City’s land area of approximately 33 square miles is mostly developed, with an estimated population of 95,388 in 2011.

With 78.5 miles of shoreline at the zero mile post of the Intercoastal Waterway, which

runs from Boston to Florida, Portsmouth’s location on navigable waterways has proven a

dominant force in the City’s history and economy. Its location on the 40 plus foot deep Hampton Roads shipping channel, and the presence of both the CSX and Norfolk Southern Railroads

supports the national and international port commerce activities and military presence in the region. Portsmouth is home to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, a government facility with

approximately 9,000 employees, the U.S. Coast Guard Fifth District Headquarters with

approximately 2,500 employees, and the Naval Regional Medical Center (U.S. Naval Hospital)

with approximately 7,000 employees. Although economic activity in the City has been

historically associated with the port and military activities in the region, Portsmouth’s economy has diversified in recent years with increasing employment in the service, manufacturing and professional sectors.

Portsmouth is an independent, full-service city with sole local governmental taxing power

within its boundaries. It derives its governing authority from a charter granted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The governing body of the City is the City Council, which formulates policies for the administration of the City. The current charter provides for a council-Manager form of government.

Overview of Government Organization

Portsmouth operates under the Council – Manager form of government, with the City

Council consisting of a mayor and six other council members. The mayor is elected directly by the voters on an at-large, nonpartisan basis, as are the remaining members of the City Council.

The City Council is the legislative policy-making body, and the City Manager, who is appointed 2-1



by the City Council, serves as the City’s chief executive officer. The City Manager reports directly to the City Council, appoints department heads, conducts the financial business of the City, and performs other duties as required by the governing body.

The operation of public schools in Portsmouth is the responsibility of the School Board,

consisting of nine members elected by the citizens at-large for four-year terms. By State law, the School Board operates independently from City Council, but is fiscally dependent on it. The School Board sets policies, hires the School Superintendent, and determines the use of its

funds subject to legal restrictions. The City Council appropriates an annual sum for education, which may be appropriated by category; however, the School Board determines how the funds

are spent. Taxing and appropriation authority remain with the City Council.

Overview of Governmental Services and Selected Functions

The City provides general governmental services to meet the needs of its citizens,

including police and fire protection, collection and disposal of refuse, water and sewer services, parks and recreation, libraries and cultural resources, health and social services, and street and highway maintenance. Other services provided by the City that receive partial funding from the Commonwealth include public education in Kindergarten through grade 12, and certain

technical and special education, mental health assistance, and judicial assistance.

The City’s main municipal complex includes the City Hall Building which houses nearly

all of the City’s operational departments, the Civic Center which includes the City Jail and Police Headquarters and the recently renovated and expanded Judicial Center. The City has eight fire stations, one central library with three neighborhood branch libraries, 52 City Parks totaling over 402 acres, seven community centers, two municipal golf courses and 25 public education

facilities located throughout Portsmouth.

Portsmouth Public Schools

The Portsmouth Public Schools program is designed to provide quality instruction to all children who enroll. The School System employs 2,469 people, including 1,112 teachers and 1,357

support staff and administrative staff. The system operates 25 public education facilities as described in the following table and during the 2012 academic year had an average daily

membership of 14,256. The City’s three high schools are operated as magnet schools with

each focusing on one of the following areas: math, science and technology; performing arts; and international studies. In fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the school system occupied 26 total 2-2



education and operation related facilities; 3 preschools (solely dedicated), 1 elementary and Pre-K school (combination) 12 elementary schools, 3 middle schools, 3 high schools and 3

centers (DAC, Instruction Resource, and S. H. Clarke) and 1 bus garage.

Public Safety

The Police Department is responsible for enforcing the law, maintaining public order,

protecting the constitutional rights of individuals, and providing a wide variety of public services in partnership with the community. The Police Department currently consists of 263 sworn

officers. Uniform Patrol is deployed on a 24/7 basis and provides the immediate response to the daily calls for police services in the City. These officers handle a wide variety of service requests in both emergency and routine categories. Command personnel are charged to

closely evaluate changing conditions on the street and deploy personnel in an effective manner in order to maintain public order. In addition, the Police Department has a number of support positions filled by both sworn and civilian personnel who are assigned various tasks that include animal control, security guards, communications dispatchers, administrative, and

property/evidence personnel. These support functions play a major role in providing effective police services to the community.

The Police Department has implemented a Community Policing Program, which includes

initiatives such as the Police Service Areas that coincide with the neighborhoods in the City of Portsmouth. Neighborhood Impact Officers work with the community stakeholders throughout

the city in order to improve the quality of life of residents, business owners and visitors.

The Police Department has also implemented a School Resource Officer program which

assigns police officers to specific schools in order to: (1) provide a positive role model for the students, (2) build strong working relationships with the faculty and administration; and (3) investigate criminal activity occurring on school grounds. Additionally, the Police Department staffs a number of highly trained and qualified individuals who are responsible to conduct

criminal investigations, narcotics enforcement, traffic enforcement and emergency response

services.

The Portsmouth Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services provides fire

protection, emergency medical care, hazardous materials response, disaster preparedness

services, arson investigation, fire prevention, inspection and training for the citizens and businesses of Portsmouth. The Department currently has authorized 227 sworn firefighters

2-3



serving the City from 8 stations. The Department also operates five ambulances. The

Department currently has 18 non-sworn and part-time members who provide administrative

clerical and support duties.

Public Works

The Department of Public Works provides various services related to the operation and

maintenance of the City’s infrastructure. The Public Works Department, staffed by 40 full-time employees, repairs and maintains the approximate 395 miles of primary and secondary streets in Portsmouth. Additionally, the Department is responsible for operation of the City’s

stormwater management and mosquito control programs.

Social Services

The Department of Social Services, staffed by 209 full-time employees, carries out

responsibility for the administration of federal and state mandated human services programs for the City including Child and Family Services (Child Protective Services, Foster Care, Adoption Services, Adult Services, Adult Protective Services and Generic Service Intake) and Financial Services Administration including initial and on-going case management for Temporary

Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Food Stamps, Energy Assistance Program

(EAP), Virginia Independence Program (VIP), and Virginia’s Initiative for Employment not

Welfare (VIEW). Additionally, the Department is responsible for eligibility determination for the Tax Relief and Tax Assistance Program.

Department of Public Utilities

The Portsmouth Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) operates the City-owned water

and wastewater utilities, distributing water to over 120,000 customers in Portsmouth,

Chesapeake and Suffolk. DPU also provides sewage collection and conveyance services to

approximately 100,000 customers in Portsmouth and part of Chesapeake. DPU is responsible

for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the water and sewerage systems as well as billing and collection. In carrying out these responsibilities, DPU employs 139 full-time personnel, distributed among its three major operating divisions: Administration and Fiscal, Water Treatment and Operations.

The water system includes approximately 3,300 acres of land including four

interconnected reservoirs and five deep wells located in the City of Suffolk. In addition, the 2-4



water system includes a water filtration plant, raw water and finished water pumping stations, elevated and ground storage tanks, and distribution systems with associated appurtenances

and meters. The lakes and wells provide a total safe yield of 29.6 million gallons per day (“mgd”) of water. Present consumption is estimated at 18 mgd. The water is treated in a single treatment plant located in Suffolk with a 33 mgd capacity and is then pumped approximately 18

miles through underground pipes to storage areas in Portsmouth which are capable of storing nine million gallons. The treatment plant facilities have undergone several modernizations and upgrades, the last having been completed in November 2011.

Independent Commissions and Authorities

A number of independent commissions and authorities participate in the performance of

various governmental functions in Portsmouth, including housing and economic development.

Selected entities are described below.

Portsmouth Redevelopment and Housing Authority

The Portsmouth Redevelopment and Housing Authority consist of seven commissioners

appointed by City Council for a four-year term. This semi-independent agency has

responsibility for administration of 3 public housing projects, 13 redevelopment projects, 3 tax credit developments, a City-wide conservation program and physical improvements funded by

the Community Development Block Grant Program.

The Authority has 92 employees. The Authority was established in 1938 primarily to

oversee the housing parks then under construction. Since 1960, under the former Urban

Renewal Program, 13 separate redevelopment projects have been undertaken. Since 1975, the

Authority has carried out for the City similar activities under the Community Development Block Grant Program.

Since 1972, as a result of redevelopment projects, the City and the Authority have

helped obtain more than $350 million in private funds or commitments, in addition to nearly $200 million in Federal and state funds. The Authority has received two HOPE VI Revitalization Grants since 1997 totaling $45 million. In four of the City’s historic districts, these activities have concentrated on rehabilitation of existing residential structures. Other projects have included clearance of blighted structures to make land available for new residential, commercial,

industrial or mixed use development.

Economic Development Authority

The Economic Development Authority of the City of Portsmouth (“EDA”) is a public body

existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The EDA was created on December

20, 1968, by an ordinance adopted by the City Council. The EDA is governed by a board of

seven directors, appointed by the City Council and functions in a dual capacity as

landholder/marketing agent for various publicly owned lands throughout the City. The EDA is directly involved with many of the economic development and redevelopment activities within the City.

Portsmouth Parking Authority

The Portsmouth Parking Authority was established in 1964 by the General Assembly of

Virginia for the purpose of providing and operating parking facilities within the corporate limits of the City. The Parking Authority currently owns and operates four parking garages and eight surface parking lots. These combined facilities provide 1,981 parking spaces for rental on a monthly basis. In addition, there are 426 on street parking meters and 153 meters in off-street lots operated and maintained by the Authority, 238 spaces in Olde Towne parking lots and an additional 678 spaces on the street including handicapped parking spaces. The construction of the Renaissance Hotel and the adjoining public parking garage structure on the City’s waterfront provide approximately 250 additional public parking spaces and 200 additional private parking spaces. All parking facilities and parking meters are located in the City’s downtown business district.

Budget Process

Formulation of the City Manager’s Proposed Budget

According to the City Charter, the City Manager is required to prepare and submit to the

City Council an annual budget. The annual budget process begins in the fall of the preceding fiscal year. In November, the department heads and the City Manager meet to discuss the

upcoming year’s priorities. The year’s priorities and budget calendar are developed at this time.

The calendar establishes the budget development schedule and the formal schedule for City

Manager’s presentations to City Council during public work sessions, for public hearings, and the budget adoption.

Departmental requests are developed based on projected needs and must be related to

the organization’s program objectives. These requests are received and compiled by the

budget staff. The City Manager prioritizes requests and recommends a Proposed Budget to

City Council based on available resources.

2-10





City Manager’s Authorization

By City Code, during the course of the fiscal year, provided there is no increase in

expense, the City Manager is authorized to effect office consolidations or make other changes for the City’s betterment. Also, at any time during the fiscal year, the City Manager may

transfer, within the same fund, any unencumbered appropriations less than $100,000 from one department, project, or purpose to another department, project, or purpose.

Budget Implementation

Once the budget is adopted for the fiscal year, on July 1, it becomes each department’s

financial legal basis. No department or other City government agency may spend in excess of approved and appropriated amounts. To ensure conformity with the adopted budget, financial

and programmatic monitoring of departmental activities occurs throughout the year. Copies of the Adopted Budget can be found in the Library and all City offices. A copy may be obtained from the Department of Finance (budget@portsmouthva.gov), or accessed on the Web at

www.portsmouthva.gov/Finance/2013AdoptedBudget/

Amendment of the Budget

As prescribed by Section 15.2-2507 of the Code of Virginia (1997), amendments to the

final adopted budget must follow the legal process. Any such amendment which exceeds one

percent (1%) of the total revenue shown in the currently adopted budget must be preceded with a published notice of a meeting and a public hearing. The newspaper must have a general

circulation in the locality and must be circulated seven days prior to the meeting date. The notice must state Portsmouth’s intent to amend the budget and include a brief synopsis of the proposed budget amendment. After first providing a public hearing, the amendment may be

adopted at the advertised meeting.

Financial Policies – Recommended Changes are Highlighted

Policy Purpose

The financial integrity of our City government is of utmost importance. To that end, the

establishment of appropriate financial management, debt administration, budget and capital

plan development, and long-range planning policies (“Financial Policies”) promote the fiscal health of Portsmouth, as well as the cost-effective and efficient delivery of services to our citizens.



2-12



Written, adopted financial policies have many benefits, such as assisting the elected

officials and staff in the financial management of the City, saving time and energy when

discussing financial matters, engendering public confidence, and providing continuity over time as elected officials and staff members change. These policies are reviewed annually and

reaffirmed by City Council at least once every three years.



Financial Policy Linkages

The City has developed these Financial Policies, with input from its Financial Advisor,

based upon municipal finance “Best Practices” as promulgated by the Government Finance

Officers Association and the National Advisory Council on State and Local Budgeting. The City and its agents will regularly monitor the evolution of such “Best Practices” and update these Financial Policies and the City’s operating practices accordingly.



General Financial Principles

The City will continuously evaluate programs and operating practices as a means of

ensuring the City’s residents an efficient and highly effective local government.



The City will strive to utilize technological advances as a means of increasing employee

productivity and reducing the need for new positions.



The City will allocate new dollars (after meeting fixed commitments such as debt service

requirements and benefits changes) to the key priority areas as established by Council.



The City will attempt to utilize benefits of new economic development successes as a

means of maintaining an adequate tax rate for services rendered to our residents coupled with our ability to manage expectations with the long term operational needs of the City.



REVENUES



Revenue Diversification



The City will strive to maintain diversified and stable revenue streams to protect the

government from problematic fluctuations in any single revenue source and provide stability to ongoing services.

2-13



Fees and Charges



All fees established by the City for licenses, permits, fines, services, applications and

other miscellaneous charges shall be set to recover all or a portion of the City’s expense in providing the attendant service. Fees and charges will be reviewed annually in connection with the development of the operating budget.



Use of One-Time Revenues



The City will not utilize one-time revenues for recurring operating expenditures. One-

time revenues include, but are not limited to: proceeds from the sale of land or surplus

equipment, legal settlements, or revenue windfalls (i.e.; unusually large building permits, etc.).



Conservative Estimation



Revenues will be budgeted conservatively so as not to introduce regular shortfalls in

individual revenue accounts. Revenue estimates shall be reviewed and validated, whenever

possible, by an independent outside professional engaged by the City. The Budget Officer shall utilize appropriate collection percentages in estimating revenues for each account or class of accounts based upon historical collection patterns. Unusual economic circumstances shall

require adjustments to collection assumptions.



BUDGET



Balanced Budget



The City’s budgetary policies are based upon guidelines and restrictions established by

State and City Codes and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Governmental entities.

These provisions set forth the City’s fiscal year, public hearing and advertising requirements, restrictions on taxation, and also stipulate that the City must maintain a balanced budget.



The City will annually adopt and execute a biennial budget for such funds as may be

required by law or by sound financial practices and generally accepted accounting principles.

2-14



The budget shall control the levy of taxes and the expenditure of money for all City purposes during the ensuing fiscal year.



The City’s budget may be considered balanced if estimated revenues meet planned

expenditures.



Contingency Appropriation



The budget shall strive to include in the annual budget a contingency appropriation of at

least 0.5% of budgeted expenditures. The contingency appropriation is designed to meet

unanticipated revenue shortfalls or emergency expenditures.



Use of Fund Balance



While accumulated fund balance in the General Fund may legally be used as revenue to

support the budget, the City’s intention is not to use fund balance to fund recurring operating expenditures. Accumulated fund balance over and above the City’s fund balance target may be considered for funding one-time expenditures.



Quarterly Budget Monitoring



Staff will provide City Council with a quarterly update of actual revenues and

expenditures for the Fiscal Year and comparisons will be made in such report to: (1) the

adopted budget, and (2) revenues and expenditures through the same period of the immediately prior Fiscal Year. Tabular presentations will be supplemented by sufficient narrative to explain material variances from budget and the prior year. These reports are intended to provide

sufficient information to City Council to allow for mid-year budget adjustments necessary to avoid operating budget shortfalls. As appropriate, Staff will provide recommendations for

amendments to the budget to ensure budgetary balance.





2-15



FUND BALANCE



Policy Minimum



The City will maintain an Unrestricted, Unassigned General Fund Balance equal to 15%

of General Fund revenues.



If the Unrestricted, Unassigned General Fund Balance falls below the minimum level

described above, Staff will submit a detailed plan (“Staff Plan”) to City Council that proposes actions necessary to return the fund balance to the policy minimum over not more than two

succeeding Fiscal Years. City Council shall act upon the Staff Plan by taking the actions

necessary to implement same or substituting alternatives that achieve the same objective.



If, upon the effective date of these Financial Policies, the City is not in compliance with this Fund Balance Policy Minimum, the City Staff will prepare a Staff Plan to restore the fund balance to the policy level and such plan will be presented within not more than three (3)

months from the effective date.



DEBT MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES



All long-term financings shall comply with Federal, State, and City Charter requirements.



Accompanying each long-term financial obligation will be a cost benefit analysis, the

identification of the funding source, an assessment of the ability to repay the obligation, the impact on the current budget, commitments to the future budgets, maintenance and operational impact of the facility or asset and the impact on the City’s credit rating.



The project should be incorporated into the City’s multi-year capital and equipment

improvement plan.



The term of the long-term obligation for the acquisition, replacement or expansion of

physical assets, will not exceed the useful life or the average life of the project or projects being financed.



2-16



Long-term financial obligations will not be used to meet current operations, or for

recurring purposes.



Variable rate obligations shall not exceed 15% of the City’s outstanding long-term

obligations and must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer.



The City Council may consider conduit financing on behalf of the EDA, PRHA, and PPIC

upon recommendation of the Debt Advisory Committee. Initial contact will be directed to the Chief Financial Officer. Council will consider whether the conduit is feasible, financially and economically prudent, coincides with the City’s objectives, and does not impair the City’s creditworthiness (All expenses related to the conduit financing will be borne by the applicants).



Except as noted below, long-term obligations issued through the City must qualify for an

underlying (i.e.; rated on the basis of the security for the loan) investment grade rating by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies or qualify for alternative credit enhancement. An exception to this requirement would be debt issued via the Virginia Resources Authority, a

political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In the case of long-term obligations that are privately placed as bank qualified investments by the City, such obligations would not be required to qualify for an investment grade rating.



The City shall encourage and maintain good relations with credit rating agencies,

investors in the City’s long-term financial obligations, and those in the financial community who participate in the issuance and sale of our long-term obligations. A policy of full and open disclosure on every financial report and long-term obligation transaction will be enforced and credit rating agency presentations/updates shall be conducted at least annually.



The City shall comply with all on-going disclosure requirements and shall file such

documents in a timely manner.



The City shall monitor earnings on bond proceeds and rebate excess earnings as

required to the U.S. Treasury to avoid the loss of tax-exempt status.



The City will enforce filing notices of completion on all projects within five years of their financing.

2-17





The City shall continually review outstanding obligations and aggressively initiate

refinancings when economically feasible and advantageous.



The Chief Financial Officer will periodically report unspent capital project funds to the

City Manager and City Council not less than annually.



Debt Administration





The City shall comply with the Internal Revenue Code Section 148 — Arbitrage Regulations

for all tax-exempt debt issued. An annual estimate of arbitrage liabilities shall be obtained by the City and recorded on the financial statements.



A good faith deposit of 2.0% of the par amount of the bond sale shall be presented by the

underwriter in the form of a check or surety acceptable to the City and Bond Counsel prior to the approval of the bonds by the Mayor and City Council.





The City shall use a competitive bidding process in the sale of debt unless the use of a

negotiated process is warranted due to market timing requirements (refunding), or a unique

pledge or debt structure. The City will award competitively issued debt on a true interest cost (TIC) basis.





The City welcomes ideas and proposals from investment bankers and will seek to give first

consideration to those firms that submit unique and innovative ideas that benefit the City.

Unsolicited proposals should be submitted to the City’s Chief Financial Officer.



The selection of an underwriter or group of underwriters for a negotiated sale shall be based on the following factors:



• Participation in the City’s competitive sales;

• Submission of unique or creative proposals;

• Qualifications of firm;

• Size and geographic distribution of their sales staff.



2-18





All professional service providers selected in connection with the City’s debt issuance

and management program shall be chosen through a competitive process such as request for

proposals (RFP’s) on an as needed basis.





The use of reimbursement resolutions shall be encouraged as a cash management tool

for debt funded projects. Reimbursement resolutions may be used for any project that has been approved in the City’s Capital Budget. Reimbursement resolutions may be used for other

projects if the projects are revenue supported or fund within departments’ operating budget.





The City shall obtain a clear opinion from qualified legal counsel that the City is not liable for the payment of principal and/or interest in the event of default by a conduit borrower. If no such opinion can be obtained, the conduit borrower will be required to purchase insurance or a letter of credit in the City’s name in the event of default. Examples of a conduit issuer are special authorities, tax-increment financing districts, public improvement districts, or industrial development issuers.



Debt Capacity and Affordability



A long-term debt capacity and affordability analysis will be completed on an annual basis as a means of ensuring that the City does not exceed its ability to service current and future debt requirements. This analysis will verify that the City is maintaining the following ratios and will be performed in conjunction with the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) process. The

guidelines that are utilized for direct City debt are as follows:



1. The ratio of All Net Tax-Supported Debt Service to Total Combined General Fund and

School Revenues should not exceed 10% 12%, within the six-year CIP projection;



2. The ratio of Net Tax-Supported Debt Service to Market Value should not exceed four percent (4%), within the six-year CIP projection;



3. The 10 Year Debt Payout Ratio of Net Tax-Supported Debt Service Should Be Greater Than

or Equal To 50%.





2-19



Utility Fund Debt



The City will adopt annual water and sewer rates that will generate sufficient revenues to

meet the legal requirements of Enterprise Fund bond covenants. These rates will also allow for adequate capital replacement in water and sewer systems.



Refunding Bonds



The City, with the assistance of its Financial Advisor, shall monitor the City’s debt

portfolio on a regular basis for refunding opportunities. When contemplating a refunding, the City will have a minimum of 3.0% economic savings (as expressed on a net present value

basis) as a benchmark to proceed with a refunding. This policy is not intended to preclude the possibility of refunding one or more maturities of existing debt that generate a lesser amount of net present value savings if conditions warrant, but it is the intention to generate overall net present value savings equal to at least 3.0% of refunded par amount on any given transaction.



The City may from time to time consider a restructuring of its existing debt. Such

restructurings are not subject to the net present value savings threshold identified above, but should be undertaken only rarely and the rationale and possible ramifications explained fully to the City Council.



CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM GUIDELINES



The City will develop a Five-Year Capital Improvement Program annually. The first year

of this plan will be approved and appropriated by the City Council after legal advertising and public hearing requirements have been met.



The City will continue to enhance the level of pay-as-you-go funding in the annual

Capital budget as a means of reducing reliance on debt financing for capital projects.



The City will maintain its physical assets at a level adequate to protect the City’s capital investment and minimize future maintenance and replacement costs. The operating budget will provide for the adequate maintenance of these facilities and infrastructure.



2-20



RETIREMENT SYSTEM FUNDING



The City will use an actuarially-accepted method of funding its City managed pension

systems to achieve a fully-funded status and will continually strive to attain fully-funded pensions.



OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (OPEB) FUNDING



The City will implement the accounting precepts of the Governmental Accounting

Standards Board’s Statement #45 and, if required, Statement #43. A funding strategy will be developed that sets aside resources to pre-fund OPEB liabilities on an actuarially sound basis over time, although as of the effective date of these Financial Policies, the City has no plans to establish an irrevocable trust fund to accumulate assets. In light of ongoing discussions

regarding national health care, the City will determine the utility of a trust fund at a later date and amend these Financial Policies as necessary once a final decision regarding the establishment of a trust fund is made.



INVESTMENT POLICY



By State statute, the City Treasurer is responsible for the investment of the City’s

operating and bond funds consistent with the Code of Virginia. The Treasurer operates under a written investment policy that provides policy guidance on the placement of investments.



In addition to the functions of the City Treasurer, City Staff will annually review the

investment program of the City. The City’s Financial Advisor shall prepare, in consultation with Staff, an “Annual Investment of City Funds” report to be delivered within three months of the close of the Fiscal Year. This report will analyze, amongst other items:

1. Compliance with adopted investment policy guidelines;

2. Diversification of investments;

3. Concentration of trades with broker-dealers; and

4. Benchmarking of investment return performance against relevant peer comparisons.





2-21



SPECIAL REVENUE / ENTERPRISE FUNDS



It is the general policy of the City to avoid designation of discretionary funds in order to maintain maximum financial flexibility. The City may, however, create dedicated funding sources when there are compelling reasons based on state law or policy objectives. Polices will be

developed for the use of each fund.



OVERSIGHT



Independent Audit



The City will be audited annually by an independent external auditing firm that

specializes in independent financial and compliance auditing services. The audit will comply fully with the Code of Virginia, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and federal requirements for “Single Audit.”



The City will competitively procure external auditing services rotate external auditing

firms not less than once every five (5) years.





Fund Structure

Governmental Fund Types

Municipal functions are financed through the use of governmental funds. The

municipality’s acquisition, use, and balance of expendable financial resources and related

liabilities are accounted for through governmental funds. This excludes proprietary funds and similar trust funds. The municipality budgets the following major governmental funds:



General Fund - The General Fund is the municipality’s general operating fund. With the exception of financial resources required to be accounted for in another fund, the General Fund is used to account for all financial resources.

2-22



Capital Projects Fund ( Capital Improvement Fund) – With the exception of capital improvements financed by proprietary funds, the Capital Improvement Fund accounts for major capital facility acquisition or construction financial resources.

The City budgets the following minor governmental funds:

Special Revenue Funds - Special revenue funds are used as legally restrictive revenue sources for expenditures having specified purposes.

Capital Projects Fund ( Community Development Fund) – Pursuant to the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act, the Community Development Fund is used to implement various

capital project programs.

Permanent Fund ( Cemetery Fund) – Cemetery Fund revenues are derived from the sale of cemetery lots, perpetual care payments, donations and legacies. These funds are designated

for the care of cemetery lots. The principal of such funds shall not be expended for any other purpose.

The City budgets the following major proprietary funds:

Enterprise Funds - Enterprise funds are used to account for operations financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises. Upon providing goods or services to the

general public on a continual basis, the governing body intent is to recover expenses, including depreciation, through user charges where the governing body has decided periodic

determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for

capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability, or other purposes. The City budgets the following minor proprietary funds:

Enterprise Fund (Port Facility and Economic Development Fund) – The Port Facility and

Economic Development Fund is used to account for the lease to a marine terminal facility and lease-purchase land sale to the Virginia Port Authority.

Internal Service Funds - Internal Service Funds are used to account for the financing of goods or services provided by one department to other departments, City agencies, or some agencies external to the City on a cost-reimbursement basis. The City has three internal service funds: City Garage Fund, Computer Services Fund and Risk Management and Insurance Fund.



2-23



Fiduciary Fund Types

When the City holds assets in a trustee capacity or as an agent for individuals, private

organizations, other governmental units, and/or other funds, fiduciary funds are used to account for the assets. The City maintains pension trust and agency funds. The Pension Trust Funds account for the City's retirement plan assets. Agency funds are custodial in nature (assets equal liabilities) and do not involve operational measurement results. Fiduciary funds are minor funds and are not included in the government-wide financial statements.

Basis of Budgeting

The budgets of the Governmental funds (for example, the General Fund, Enterprise

Funds, Internal Service Funds) are prepared on a modified accrual basis. The

expenditures/obligations of the City (purchase orders, direct payment, etc.) are budgeted as expenditures; however, revenues are recognized when they can be measured and are

available.

In cases where goods and services are not received by year end, encumbrances are

reviewed for valid year end adjustment entries. Based on the date of the purchase order for contractual services, encumbrances are carried over into the next fiscal year.

Basis of Accounting

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) displays the City’s expenses and

revenues according to General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This also conforms to the methodology in which the City prepares the annual budget.

Exceptions are identified below:

• Principal payments on long-term debt are applied to the outstanding liability on a GAAP

basis, as opposed to being expended on a budgetary basis.

• Capital Outlay within the Enterprise Funds is recorded as assets on a GAAP basis as

opposed to being expended on a budgetary basis.

• Depreciation expense is recorded on a GAAP basis only.

• Governments typically liquidate their accrued liabilities with expendable available financial resources. Accordingly, an expenditure is normally recognized in a governmental fund at the same time that a liability is incurred. Such is not the case with compensated absences.

2-24



Under modified accrual accounting, these expenditures and liabilities are recognized when

they mature (when due).

• The accrual basis of accounting is used to determine the amount of the liability related to compensated absences that should be presented on the balance sheet of a proprietary

fund. In determining the amount, the total amount of the estimated debt should is presented as a liability (not just the portion of the debt that will use expendable financial resources).

Capital Improvements Program

The City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP) is a five-year plan which addresses both repair and replacement of existing infrastructure as well as the construction or acquisition of new facilities and equipment to accommodate current and future demands for service.

Capital expenditures are accounted for in their respective funds, including the General Fund, the capital improvements funds, the internal service funds and the enterprise funds. The General Fund contains projects related to general governmental services in areas such as general

administration, facilities maintenance, public safety and parks and recreation. Vehicle

maintenance is accounted for in an internal service fund. Its customers are user departments of the City and these projects are funded primarily from user charges. Solid waste, water and sewer projects may be found in the Enterprise Funds section.

Financing of the CIP is provided on a pay-as-you-go basis or through debt issuance. Pay-as-you-go funding is provided from several sources including current tax revenues, interest

earnings, revenue from other governmental agencies and user fees. Debt funding may include general obligation bonds, revenue bonds or lease financing.

Prioritization of the City’s capital needs is essential in the development of the City’s CIP. The City created the CIP Development Team in order to review and analyze existing and future

capital projects as well as potential funding strategies and options which must align with City Council’s prioritization and with the City’s vision. This team utilizes benchmarked evaluation criteria to prioritize and recommend the capital budget and the five-year CIP.

Year one of the five-year CIP is the Capital Budget for FY2014. Some projects are multi-year projects and will be carried over from prior years. The CIP categories of Drainage and Street Improvements, Education, Industrial and Economic Development, Leisure Services, Municipal

Facilities and Parking Authority primarily reflect projects being sustained from prior fiscal years.

2-25



These projects are all vital to the continuing quality of life enjoyed by the citizens of the City of Portsmouth.

The availability of funding limits the number of new projects; however, certain asset investments are essential to continue operating actives of certain departments and divisions. Some new projects included in this budget are highlighted:

• School Bus Fleet Replacement - the rotation of aged buses out of the fleet and replacement of the same provides for the transportation of school aged citizens to and from their

respective learning institutions. This bus fleet also supports the transportation of students to off campus sporting events, educational field trip destinations and to the Portsmouth

Campus of Tidewater Community College where students engage in higher education

studies.

• Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Crime Analysis Systems – these two new systems,

utilized by law enforcement, will contribute to the preservation of safe neighborhoods and

business districts throughout the City. These systems will function independently and

collectively. The CAD system tracks information from emergency callers and aids

deployment of the appropriate personal and equipment required to address the emergency.

The Crime Analysis System will support the rapid assessment and dissemination of key

information to law enforcement.

• Case Management System – this system will support the workflow activities of the

Commonwealth Attorney’s Office, as it replaces a system that is being retired by the state. It will track all cases activities from inception to their final disposition.

• Revenue System – the offices of the City Treasurer and the Commissioner of Revenue are

in need of a system that excesses all revenue collection information via a single point of

origin. This new system provides for a more efficient and effective manner of operation and customer service.

• Behavioral Health Building – this new facility will consolidate the primary operating staff and activities of the department. It will occupy property owned by the city adjacent to the Social Services building. This location is an essential node of activity connecting the Downtown

and Midtown districts of the City. It is projected; the construction of the approximate 30,000

+ square foot facility will be completed in FY14. Bond proceeds from prior years’ debt

issues are available for project design and construction.

City

The Virginia Constitution authorizes Virginia cities to issue general obligation bonds, secured Indebtedness by a pledge of full faith and credit. For the payment of such bonds, the city’s governing body is required to levy, if necessary, an ad valorem tax on all property subject to local taxation.

General obligation bond issuance is subject to a 10 percent limitation of the assessed value of taxable real property in the City. The City has a self-imposed debt service limit of 12% of general fund revenues.



In determining the debt limitation, certain classes of indebtedness may be excluded, including revenue anticipation notes maturing in one year or less, referendum approved general

obligation bonds payable from a specified revenue producing undertaking (as long as the

undertaking is self-supporting), and revenue bonds. The City’s Public Utility bonded debt is a self-supporting referendum-approved general obligation and excluded from the City’s legal

debt limit. In addition, the City’s lease-purchase obligations which are subject to annual appropriation are excluded from the City’s legal debt limit.



The following table shows the Legal Debt Margins for five Fiscal Years ending June 30.

* Estimated



Overlapping or Underlying Debt

The City of Portsmouth is autonomous and entirely independent of any county or other

political subdivision. It is not subject to taxation by any county or school district, nor is it liable for any county or school district indebtedness.



The City Council authorized the creation of the New Port Community Development Authority

(the “New Port CDA”) in August 2005 to finance certain infrastructure improvements,

including road improvements, signage, updated and relocated utilities, lighting, fencing,

sidewalks and streetscapes (the “Improvements”), related to the construction of a high-quality planned residential community. To fund the Improvements, the New Port CDA issued

$16,240,000 in revenue bonds in May 2006 (the “CDA Bonds”), which mature September 1,

2036. The CDA Bonds are secured by and payable from special assessments (the “Special

Assessments”) to be levied by the City on the taxable parcels within the New Port CDA

District (the “District”). The CDA Bonds are also secured by funds held pursuant to an

Indenture of Trust dated May 1, 2006, between the New Port CDA and Manufacturers and

Traders Trust Company, as trustee. Pursuant to a Special Assessment Agreement dated

February 15, 2006, the City is obligated, subject to appropriation, to pay over to the New Port CDA those Special Assessments collected by the City. However, such obligations do not

constitute a general obligation of the City or a pledge of the City’s full faith and credit. The City is not responsible for paying the debt service on the CDA Bonds.



Statement of No Past Default

The City has never defaulted on any debt payment of either principal or interest.



Outstanding Debt

The City’s bonded debt consists almost entirely of general obligation bonds which are

supported by City general revenues. For the Golf Fund, the outstanding debt is secured

solely by a general obligation pledge – the full faith and credit of the City. The proprietary fund debt, consisting of the Public Utility, Parking Fund, City Garage, Waste Management,

City

and the Information Technology debt is expected to be paid from the revenues of the

Indebtedness respective enterprise and internal service funds.



Debt Ratios

The following table shows the General Debt to Property Value ratios for the fiscal years

ended 2009 through 2013. The City’s real estate assessed values are determined as of

January 1, and those values are effective for taxation as of July 1. The ratio is determined by dividing the total sales by the total of all assessed values after the annual assessment is completed. The calculations include all City debt excluding proprietary fund debt which is recorded as debt of the respective proprietary funds.

Public Utility Debt

All outstanding Public Utility bonds are general obligations of the City; however, as a

matter of practice, the City pays such bonds from its Public Utilities Fund. This is a

self-supporting Enterprise Fund. The revenues include water and sewer system fees.

In the event Public Utilities Fund fees are not sufficient to pay the debt service on

public utility bonds, the City is obligated to pay the debt service from the General

Fund or other available revenues. Public Utility bond debt service coverage by net

system revenues are shown in the following table.

Impact of Capital Budget on Debt

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia and related laws dictate the legal

limits of debt for political subdivisions. As such, the City’s only legal limit of debt is 10% of taxable real estate assessed value. The City has a debt service policy limit

of 12% of general fund budgeted revenue.

GENERAL FUND REVENUE



Revenue Projections



General Fund revenue projections for FY2014 are formulated using a combination of forecasting techniques, regional economic data and local government operational experience. In early December, six months prior to the new fiscal year, the City’s annual financial audit is usually complete. The success of the previous year’s revenue forecasts are compared and cross checked against the actual audited financial statements to determine if any refinement needs to be made to the model. Should any changes be required, they are made and refined forecasts are run for the upcoming fiscal year. These revised estimates are cross checked a second time against a variety of forecasted economic data with special emphasis on: consumer and wholesale prices, local population, retail sales, building and construction activity data, employment, wages, interest rates and federal/state funding to ensure the forecast is still consistent with future economic expectations. Continuing refinements are made as required, up until March, or about four months prior to the beginning of the new fiscal year.



Economy



Portsmouth’s economic base, consistent with the State and National trends, was impacted by the severe recession. Recovery is evolving slowly. The local economy is heavily impacted by federal spending levels as several of the major employers, such as the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the Naval Medical Center, and other naval repair facilities (public or private) receive significant federal dollars. As a result of the economic downturn, some local businesses have closed or are closing, including the former Pet Dairy facility and Gwaltney of Smithfield’s meat processing facility. The City’s population declined during the recession, further dampening local business revenue. There are positive signs, however, that the City’s economy may be turning around. Recent economic development activity includes a new Harris Teeter grocery store and Kroger Super Center. The City is hopeful that continued economic development will grow the City’s revenue base.



Revenue Assumptions



Total estimated General Fund revenue for FY2014, including transfers from other funds, is

$231,385,811 an increase of $8.16 million, or 3.66% more than the FY2013 adopted budget including a use of $5.69 million of prior year Fund Balance, primarily for one-time non-recurring items. For analytical reasons, General Fund Total Revenues are categorized into four broad categories: Local Tax Revenue, Other Local Revenue, State Revenue and Non Revenue/Transfers. The table below

summarizes General Fund revenue by category. Following is a brief discussion of the revenue 4-8



components in each of the categories, including graphs depicting the historical trends of these revenue sources as compared with future projections.

LOCAL TAX REVENUE



General Property Taxes



The majority, 73%, of the $157.8 million in Local Tax revenues is derived from General Property Tax revenues (including public service corporations).



The City levies real estate taxes on all real estate within its boundaries, except that exempted by statute, each year as of July 1, based on the estimated market value of the property, with quarterly payments due September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30. All real estate is assessed

annually. Real Property Taxes are estimated to generate $88.37 million or 38% of the City's total General Fund revenue in FY2014. Included within this total is revenue derived from delinquent real estate taxes and real estate taxes paid by public service corporations. The FY2014 revenue is calculated with a tax rate of $1.27 per $100 of assessed value reflecting no change in the tax rate from FY2013.



The City levies personal property taxes on motor vehicles and tangible personal business property.

These levies are made each year as of June 30, with annual payments due June 5. Personal Property Taxes are levied on the tangible property of individuals and businesses. For individuals, this tax is primarily on automobiles and recreational vehicles. Business personal property includes motor vehicles, machines, furniture, computers, fixtures and tools. The projection maintains the following Personal Property Tax rates: $5.00 per $100 of assessed value for tangible personal property; $3.00

per $100 of assessed value for machinery and tools; $0.50 per $100 of assessed value on boats.



The Personal Property Tax Relief Act (PPTRA) was initially enacted by the General Assembly in 1998, and actual reimbursements to localities were capped by the State in the 2004 legislative session.

Although the City now receives the same fixed dollar amount of relief each year, due to the State’s payment cap the amount of tax relief will vary by year as a percentage of the total tax. Portsmouth's payment from the State will remain constant, so as personal property values increase over time, the actual percentage of State reimbursement will continue to decrease. Personal Property Tax revenue is estimated at $23.8 million for FY2014 and is expected to increase only slightly from the FY2013 levels.

This revenue source represents 10% of total General Fund revenue. This revenue includes taxes from current and delinquent personal property and taxes on personal property owned by public service corporations.

FY2014 Budget Comments



The real property tax revenue projected for FY2014 is a decline of $1.8 million or 2% from the current fiscal year due primarily to a decline in the assessed value of residential property, particularly in condominiums.



Other Local Taxes

Other Local Taxes includes funds received for local sales tax, admission and amusement tax, bank franchise tax, business and professional licenses, licensing fees tax, lodging tax cigarette tax, recordation taxes, restaurant food tax, short term rental tax, franchise tax.



Local Sales Tax revenue is considered an elastic revenue source because it is responsive to changes in the economy. Virginia’s Sales Tax rate was increased to 5.0 % during FY2005. The Virginia General Assembly approved the increase in May 2004 and dedicated the proceeds to local education.

With the increase the State retains 4.0 % and returns 1.0 % as unrestricted revenue to the locality where the funds were collected.



Business & Professional License (BPOL) Taxes are levied on businesses operating in the City.



Lodging Taxes under the Code of Virginia are defined as “transient occupancy taxes.” These taxes are similar to the Sales Tax in that they are based on the value of a purchase, which in this case is a motel or hotel room. The Lodging Tax rate in Portsmouth is 8.0 %.



Restaurant Food Tax is assessed on the sale of prepared food and beverages sold at food

establishments in the City. The tax rate is 6.5% plus the 5 % sales tax for a total of rate of 11.5%.

FY2014 Budget Comments



Local Sales Tax revenue is projected to generate $7.06 million in FY2014, an increase of $607,447

(9%) from the current fiscal year budget, and 2.8% over the FY 2013 expected receipts. Restaurant food taxes are expected to generate 7.03 million in FY2014, an increase of 12% from the current fiscal year budget and 3.6% from FY 2013 expected actual levels. Both increases are indicative of a modest recovery from the recession in the retail sector, and include the estimated impacts of new development.

Utility Taxes



Utility taxes are applied to water, gas and electric service recipients residing within the City. In addition the City collects a Telecommunications tax on cellular telephones within the City.

FY2014 Budget Comments



Revenues from the utility taxes are expected to fall by $1.49 million in FY2014. The decline can be attributed to over budgeting in 2013 and state withholding of Portsmouth’s E911 telecommunication tax as part of a statewide “true-up” calculation.

Projections for the miscellaneous revenue line items are lowered to reflect actual trends.



STATE/FEDERAL REVENUE



Payments from the Commonwealth of Virginia are divided into three functional categories: (1) State Non-Categorical Aid. (2) State Shared Expenses and (3) State Categorical Aid. State Revenue is estimated at $38.6 million in FY14 and the City is budgeting approximately $600,000 from the Federal 4-14



government. Together this represents 18% of General Fund revenue. These types of revenue are described below.



State Non-Categorical Aid



The State provides general support to municipalities through a variety of revenue generating mechanisms. The City receives a 3% tax on mobile home title filing and 50% of the revenue collected by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the filing of deeds on property. In lieu of personal property tax revenue, the City receives a 4% daily rental tax on vehicles rented within the City.



This category also includes reimbursements from the State for implementation of the personal property tax reduction on private vehicles. The 2004 General Assembly changed this program, by adopting a $950 million statewide cap on reimbursements starting in 2006. FY07 was the first full fiscal year with this cap in place. The amount of revenue to be disbursed to Portsmouth will be the same each year: $9.9 million (PPTRA).

GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES

The General Fund, by definition, is the City’s main operating fund. Authoritative accounting standards define the General Fund as the fund used by default “to account for and report all financial resources not accounted for and reported in another fund.” Many of the primary

functions of the City along with administration are accounted for within the General Fund.

Following is a brief discussion of each business center in the General Fund.

General Government

General Government includes the departments that provide the overall general administration of the City including the City Council, City Clerk, City Manager, Management and Legislative

Affairs, Marketing and Communications, City Attorney, Human Resource Management, Civil

Service Commission, City Registrar, Commissioner of the Revenue, City Assessor, City

Treasurer, Finance and Budget, Procurement, Information Technology, and

Telecommunications and the City Internal Auditor.

FY2014 Budget Comments

General Government expenditures reflect the addition of a City Internal Audit department,

elimination of previously budgeted vacancy savings for departments/offices that do not tend to generate such savings, and an increase in the City’s Annual Required Contribution (ARC) for its two closed retirement plans. The budget also provides funds for additional staffing for the Treasurer and Commissioner of Revenue in order to increase revenue assessment and

collection. This cost is offset by additional expected revenue.

Non-Departmental

Non-Departmental accounts for services and costs not related to other departments or

agencies. Included in this section are allocations for contractual obligations or community services supported by the City, tax relief to the Elderly and Disabled citizens (Senior Citizen Tax Relief), local funding for the Portsmouth Public Schools, and Debt Service.

In each of the past four years the City has been mandated to make annual payments to the

State to help balance the Commonwealth’s budget. This “Aid to the Commonwealth” has been

eliminated for FY2014.

FY2014 Budget Comments

The Non-Departmental category reflects a $2.6 million increase in the City’s General Obligation debt service. Also included is a lump sum amount for a 3% raise for general employees and constitutional offices, as well as step increases for sworn Police and Fire employees. If

approved by City Council, the cost of these increases will be distributed to department budgets.

The pass-through of a $500,000 State grant for the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame is also reflected in the increase. Portsmouth’s share of bus service provided by Hampton Roads Transit is

estimated to increase by $274,000. The City contribution to the cost of retiree health insurance also contributes to the increased expenditure level. General Fund subsidies to City enterprise funds that are not fully self-supporting (Golf, Willett Hall and the Parking Authority) are budgeted in this department as well, and increase by a net of $51,000. Support for Civic organizations is budgeted to rise by $88,000. These increases are partially offset by the elimination of the State reductions in aid to localities.

Judicial

This business center includes civil and criminal agencies pertaining to the prosecution and adjudication including the Circuit Court Judges, Circuit Court Clerk, Magistrate, General District Court, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, Juvenile Court Services, the Sheriff and the

Commonwealth Attorney. Services provided include the provision of a judicial procedure for the enforcement of State laws and City ordinances; assisting the Circuit Court Judges; maintaining and preserving documents; hearing criminal; traffic and civil cases; and protecting the welfare of children and families. Prevention and reduction of juvenile delinquency and the provision of constitutional and municipal services for the City of Portsmouth is also included.

General District Court

Business Unit Mission Statement

The Portsmouth General District Court has primary responsibility for hearing criminal, traffic and civil cases within the Third Judicial District of Virginia. The General District Court does not conduct jury trials. A judge hears all cases in this court. Fines collected for violations of City ordinances are paid to the City Treasurer. All fines collected for violation of State law are paid to the State Treasury. Court costs are set by the State Legislature. The court cannot suspend or waive costs.

Description of Services Provided

CIVIL CASES: The General District Court decides civil suits involving amounts of money up to $15,000. A suit is begun by filing a civil warrant or motion for judgement with the clerk of the court and paying a fee. Small claims are those civil suits involving amounts of money of $1,000 or less and are within the exclusive jurisdiction of this court.

CRIMINAL CASES: The General District Court decides cases in which a person is charged with a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor is any charge which carries a penalty of no more than one year in jail or a fine of up to $2,500 or both.

The General District Court holds preliminary hearings in felony cases. Any charge which may be punishable by more than one year in jail is a felony. Preliminary hearings are held to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify holding the defendant for a grand jury hearing. The grand jury determines whether the accused will be indicted and held for trial by the Circuit Court.

Each defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon consideration of evidence, the judge decides the question of guilt or innocence and on the finding of guilt determines which penalty, if any, is proper and lawful.

TRAFFIC CASES: The General District Court hears cases in which a person is charged with a traffic offense. Most traffic offenses are infractions, which are punishable by a fine but no jail penalty. (Cases involving awards to individuals for damages in connection with traffic violations are civil in nature.) If a traffic violator is convicted of certain traffic violations, the Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles will assess points against their driver's license. This is an administrative action by DMV and is in addition to any sentence imposed by the judge.

Our mission is to administer and enforce the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and its related laws and ordinances as mandated by state and local regulations. The Department will endeavor to provide services in a professional, courteous, and timely manner, as well as provide efficient response to citizen concerns and requests for information.

Our business is to enforce the code in a fair and equitable manner while providing for consumer protection, public safety, sustainable new construction, and preservation of the city’s neighborhoods and historic character. Through fair and equitable enforcement of the code, adhering to our core values of honesty, integrity, and competency, we will transform our neighborhoods and make Portsmouth the "City of Choice" in which to live, work, visit, and invest.

Description of Services Provided

The Department of Permits & Inspections encompasses the divisions of Building, Environmental/Zoning, and Rental Inspections.

The Building Inspections Division enforces the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC) as it relates to the construction, alteration, renovation, or the change of use of buildings. It is this division’s responsibility to ensure that a structure is sound and reasonably safe from structural failure, accidental fire, and other hazards. The Building Inspections Division determines permit applicant qualifications, reviews construction documents, issues permits, and performs inspections for compliance with USBC

standards and local ordinances, as well as other related activity, as set forth in the Code of Virginia.



The Environmental/Zoning and Rental Inspections Division enforces Part III of the USBC, referred to as the Virginia Maintenance Code, as well as pertinent local ordinances as set forth in the Code of Virginia. This division performs inspections of all existing properties, owner-occupied or rental, to ensure that they meet the minimum code requirements and standards for premises, structures, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation, protection from the elements, inoperable motor vehicles, weeds and debris, safety from fire, and other hazards to protect the health, safety and welfare of our citizens. Inspectors also perform zoning investigations. Through this program the division provides oversight of the City’s Historic Districts and Downtown Design Districts, citing owners who perform exterior alterations without proper approval and/or building permits. This division also enforces the sign ordinance. Properties that have been illegally converted also come under the purview of this division for notification of violations of the City’s zoning code.

Capital Improvements

Mission Statement

The Capital Improvement Program will strive to be reflective of efforts to manage competing capital needs while protecting the lasting financial sustainability of the City.

Description of Services Provided

The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a five-year plan that addresses ongoing City infrastructure needs through replenishment and replacement projects. The CIP's first year, the capital budget, is the only appropriated year and subsequent years provide a plan for addressing future infrastructure needs with projected expenditures and resources.

The CIP is programmed in nine specific program areas:

• Water and Sewer – Through the Public Utilities Enterprise Fund, projects are funded for the water and sewer system replacement and renovation. The City's water system is aging and requires ongoing repair and rehabilitation in order to secure the City's water supply.

• Drainage and Street Improvements – Through the Stormwater Fund and the Virginia Department of Transportation funding, there are a number of infrastructure improvement projects in this program grouping.

• Education – This program area is comprised of projects that are specifically school related. These include school building replacement and facility repairs. Funding for these projects comes from the City’s local revenue, state lottery proceeds, and Virginia Public School Authority construction funds.

• Industrial and Economic Development – This area represents those projects providing for the community’s economic vitality.

These projects include gateways, pedestrian paths, neighborhood projects, and economic development support.

• Leisure Services – This program area is comprised of projects related to quality of life projects. These projects will improve the physical appearance of structures within the City’s neighborhoods and improve recreational facilities throughout the City.

• Municipal Facilities – As the municipal facilities continue to age and maintenance becomes expensive, there is an existing facility need for replacement and refurbishment particularly the City's courts facility. This funding also includes projects to meet the changing dynamics of residential and commercial densities and also new facilities.

• Parking CIP - This area represents projects providing replacement and renovations of City Parking Garages.

Strategic Plan

Prioritization of the City's capital needs is essential in the development of the City's capital improvement program (CIP). The City created the CIP Development Team in order to review and analyze existing and future capital projects as well as potential funding strategies and options which must align with City Council's prioritization and the City's vision. This team utilizes benchmarked evaluation criteria to prioritize and recommend the capital budget and 5-year CIP.

The following ten criteria are considered when staff evaluates capital projects:

Quality of Service: Measures the extent a project affects the quality of a service. Quality of a service is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness of that service. A project must demonstrate the degree it positively affects the service’s efficiency and effectiveness. A project demonstrating a high degree of impact on efficiency and effectiveness, i.e. the overall quality of the service, is awarded a high evaluation score.

Consistency with Comprehensive Plan and City Council Vision: Measures the extent a project is aligned with the Comprehensive Plan and City Council Vision. A project demonstrating its ability to address components of the Comprehensive plan, specifically the plan’s Action Initiatives and Governance Policies on Fiscal Strength, is awarded a high evaluation score.

Availability of Alternative Financing Sources: Measures the extent a project is financed through non-city funding sources.

Non-city funding sources include, but are not limited to, private investment, and federal, state or local grants. A project demonstrating ability to generate a larger percentage of non-city project cost funding is awarded a higher evaluation score.

Mandates or Other Legal Requirements: Measures the extent in which the City is legally bound in allocating resources to implement a project. Evaluation scores are based upon a project’s supporting legal documentation. A project legally bound, e.g.

federal, state and local mandate, is awarded a high evaluation score. Ratified contractual agreements with escape clauses are awarded a score of 4 and contractual agreements without an escape clause are awarded a score of 5.

Documented Community Environmental Quality (External): Measures the extent a project positively affects the City’s external environmental quality. Supporting documentation must accompany a project’s claim. A project demonstrating a direct positive Fiscal Year 2014

Extent of Impact: Measures the number of affected citizens by the project. A project demonstrating ability to impact a large percentage of the population is awarded a high evaluation score.

Project Readiness: Measures the extent a project is capable of moving beyond the planning stage; ability of project to proceed (i.e. acquiring appropriate approvals, financing and land acquisitions). A project demonstrating its ability to proceed forward, i.e.

resolve any or all obstacles to implementation, is awarded a high evaluation score.

Operational Budget Impact: Measures the extent a project impacts current programs and services as well as the City’s operating budget flexibility. Evaluation scores are based upon the project’s ability to minimize operational budget impact and generate City revenue. A project demonstrating its ability to positively impact the operational budget, through the generation of significant City revenue, is awarded a high evaluation score. Significant revenue is defined as greater than or equal to 10% of the project cost.

Health and Safety (Internal): Measures the extent a project provides increased user health and or safety. Evaluation scores are based upon whether the project maintains current health and safety standards, whether the project alleviates some actual health and or safety issue, or whether the health and or safety issue is urgent and needs immediate attention. A project demonstrating its ability to address actual and urgent safety and or health issues is awarded a high evaluation score.



Project Linkage: Measures the extent a project is related or linked to other CIP projects. Evaluation scores are based upon the degree and extent of impact the project has on other CIP projects (i.e. whether the project compliments or is essential to other CIP projects, and whether the project impacts one or more CIP projects). A project demonstrating its essential nature for the completion of multiple CIP projects is awarded a high evaluation score.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities is responsible for the operation and maintenance of 64 sewer pump stations and approximately 436 miles of gravity sewer and force mains. Over 72% of Portsmouth's sewer system is at the end of its useful engineered life. These minor projects provide for routine replacement/rehabilitation and upgrade of sewer system components, using both in-house and contract labor.

Rationale

We must continue to lower asset age. Failure of the sanitary sewer system disrupts service to our customers, causes overflows which create public health and environmental problems, and cause liability issues from possible damage to other City assets or private property.

Funding Strategy

This is an ongoing project necessary for the proper operation of the system and to limit failures due to age and deterioration.

Operating Budget Impacts

This project will lower asset age, provide for reliable system operations, reduce sewer overflow potential and overtime, and reduce annual maintenance costs.

Description and Scope

The objective of this program is to markedly reduce the overflows of sewage caused by the infiltration or inflow of ground or rain water into Portsmouth's sanitary sewer system as required by the Federal Clean Water Act and under the conditions of a voluntary consent order negotiated by the Hampton Roads localities with the State Department of Environmental Quality.

Rationale

This project is a result of a voluntary consent order with the State Department of Environmental Quality. The capacity of wastewater components such as mains and pump stations is finite. Infiltration and inflow of ground or rain water takes up the capacity of these components reserved for wastewater, and can cause sewage overflow. This can result in increased maintenance and capacity costs to customers, and poses a potential health risk to the public.

Funding Strategy

The first step in this program will be to conduct a city-wide Sanitary Sewer System Evaluation Study (SSES) to identify, categorize and prioritize sanitary sewer deficiencies and the necessary actions, phasing, and costs to correct them. This 18-24 month process will be followed by phased, multi-year corrective activities. FY2014 will see significant increases due to start up of projects mandated once the SSES is approved.

Operating Budget Impacts

Project will reduce the annual maintenance requirements, provide for reliable operations and reduce the potential for sanitary sewage overflows.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities is responsible for the operation & maintenance of approximately 436 miles of sewer mains, manholes, force mains, valves, sewer laterals and other sewage collection components. 72% of Portsmouth’s sewage system is at the end of its useful engineering life. This project provides for the replacement and or rehabilitation of minor segments of the failing sewage system, using both in-house forces and outside contractors.

Rationale

Sanitary sewer failures disrupt service to customers, cause overflows which create public health and environmental problems and cause the overlying streets and property to fail.

Funding Strategy

This is an on-going project that is necessary for the proper operation of the system due to failures caused by age and deterioration.

Operating Budget Impacts

Project will reduce the annual maintenance requirements, provide for reliable operations and reduce the potential for sanitary sewage overflows.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities is responsible for the operation & maintenance of an extensive wastewater collection system, of which 72% is at the end of its useful engineering life. Included in the wastewater collection system is 10 miles of vacuum sewer piping and 29 sewer suction wells, which serve the older Downtown, Midtown, Westhaven and Glenshellah portions of the City. This project provides for replacement and/or rehabilitation of the vacuum sewer piping and suction wells.

Rationale

•The vacuum sewer system ranges in age from 52 to 77 years old and exposure to a harsh wastewater environment has caused extensive deterioration of this system.

•Planned, phased expenditures are necessary to maintain this system’s operation and prevent failure which could have both public health and environmental consequences.

Funding Strategy

This is an on-going project that will continue until the vacuum lines and suction wells have been rehabilitated and/or replaced. A Master Plan Study to set the range of rehabilitation costs and priorities was completed in FY ’03-‘04. A pilot program to replace one section of the system, refining rehabilitation methods and costs was performed in FY04-05. Rehabilitation of the system suction wells has been completed. Future funding will begin phased replacement of the vacuum lines.

Operating Budget Impacts

Project will reduce the annual maintenance requirements, provide for reliable operations and reduce the potential for sanitary sewage overflows.

Description and Scope

This project involves rehabilitation of the 27-inch concrete sewer main which conveys wastewater from the Williams Court area to the Camden Avenue Pump Station. The rehabilitation will involve lining and/or replacement of approximately 3000 LF of 27" and 18" sewer line on George Washington Highway and Kelley Drive.

Rationale

Investigation of the sewer line during cleaning operations show that the top of the concrete pipe has eroded away due to the release of hydrogen sulfide gas during turbulent wastewater flow. If left unchecked, resulting sanitary sewer overflows would have major public health and environmental issues.

Funding Strategy

Funding to come from Public Utilities General Obligation Bonds.

Operating Budget Impacts

Project would minimize operating costs for Public Utilities.

Description and Scope

The Downtown Area contains some of Portsmouth oldest water and wastewater system components. Replacement of aged and inadequate water distribution and wastewater collection and conveyance systems in the Downtown Area are required to support the redevelopment of this critical area as envisioned by the Downtown Strategic Plan prepared by Urban Design Associates. Expected limits of the area are the Elizabeth River on the east, Crawford Parkway on the north, Chestnut Street/Fort Lane on the west, and I-264 on the south.

Rationale

The average age of these water and wastewater components is 100 years, well beyond their useful life. In order to adequately support the proposed redevelopment, replacement of these components is critical.

Funding Strategy

Phasing of this project will be tied to the redevelopment phases outlined in the Downtown Strategic Plan. The first phase will be to prepare construction documents for the entire phased project followed by a multi-year construction implementation program.

Operating Budget Impacts

This project will reduce the possibility of major water and sewer system failures in the Downtown area, decreasing maintenance requirements as more piping is replaced.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities has developed an aggressive program for replacing or rehabilitating the water and sewer infrastructure throughout the City. This work is based upon the age and condition of the water and sewer infrastructure.

Rationale

•Approximately 63% of Portsmouth’s neighborhood water and sewer infrastructure is past its useful life. The age and condition of the water mains pose potential water quality problems and real problems with pressure, flow and leakage. The age and condition of the sewer lines pose potential leakage and cave-in problems, which can impede sewage flow and cause backups.

•The Master Infrastructure Rehabilitation Plan, the Strategic Financial Plan and the Asset Replacement Valuation Study of the Department of Public Utilities all support this project.

Funding Strategy

•This is an on-going project that will continue until all mains that are past their useful life are replaced.

Operating Budget Impacts

This project will reduce the possibility of major water and sewer system failures, decreasing maintenance requirements as more piping is replaced.

Debt service and rates will increase to support this program.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities operates a system of four reservoirs. The Department maintains raw water intakes on two of the four reservoirs.

This project would provide a raw water intake with a connection to the Lake Kilby Plant from a third reservoir, Lake Cohoon. Lake Cohoon contains 53% of the combined reservoir’s supply capacity.

Rationale

•Construction of an intake on Lake Cohoon would provide a transmission source on the northern sub-basin of Portsmouth’s reservoir system, thereby increasing protection against contamination events. Additionally water could be blended for both sub-basins feeding the terminal reservoir allowing for water quality adjustments.

•Construction of a separate access to the largest reservoir system sub-basin provides additional reliability that does not currently exist.

Description and Scope

The Department of Public Utilities operates the Lake Kilby Water Treatment Facility. This project provides for the replacement of filters 1 through 10

at the treatment facility with conventional media filters or with membrane technology.

Rationale

•Filters 1-4 were constructed in 1947 and filters 5-10 were constructed in 1968. The concrete filter boxes for some of these filters were constructed without reinforcing steel (post World War II constraint) and are now deteriorating. Additionally, the southwest corner of the filter building was not pile supported and has settled significantly. These filters have outlived or are nearing the end of their useful lives.

•To insure the continued integrity, capacity and operation of the Lake Kilby Treatment Facility it is important that these filters be replaced with either new conventional media filters or with the use of membrane technology.

•Project Source document: Lake Kilby Water Facility Master Plan 2001 Update, page 6-5, Table 6-3

Funding Strategy

Evaluation and study will determine the multiphasing of this project and its cost.

Operating Budget Impacts

Once completed, this project will have minimal impact on the operating budget.

Description and Scope

•The Department of Public Utilities operates three low pressure transmission mains that convey water from the Lake Kilby Water Treatment Plant in Suffolk, 23 miles into Portsmouth. These mains were constructed in 1888, 1906 and 1950. This project provides for a plan to evaluate the remaining life of these mains and address the best way to provide for the transmission of current and future City water demand in a phased, affordable manner.

Total replacement may cost in excess of $60 million dollars.

Rationale

These three pipelines have been in service between 53 and 116 years and are an important part of Portsmouth’s water transmission system. They exhibit leaking joints and other signs of deterioration. This project is necessary to protect the water transmission capability of Portsmouth’s water supply and to provide safe and reliable service.

Funding Strategy

The only portions of this project to be performed during the next five years are an evaluation of the mains, the completion of a phased plan for their replacement or rehabilitation and the construction of the first phase. Total replacement may cost in excess of $60 million dollars.

Operating Budget Impacts

Once completed, this major project will reduce annual maintenance requirements, will increase system reliability and will reduce lost or unaccounted for water.

Description and Scope

This project will upgrade the traffic signal system at Alexander’s Corner and the nearby intersection at Turnpike and Portsmouth Boulevard. The project will include new span support, LED signal heads, video detection, controller, and back-up battery power. Project will also include repaving and layout improvements to the intersection.

Rationale

The signal at this intersection is very old and in need of repair. Due to the size and complexity of the intersection, the costs to upgrade have been high. However, because the City has received federal grant funds from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program, the project is able to proceed.

Funding Strategy

The project is funded 100% by federal grant money which will be run through VDOT.

Operating Budget Impacts

Although the operating budget impact is minimal; operating costs will decrease due to the efficiency of the LED heads.

Description and Scope

This project provides funding to replace the two westbound lanes of the Churchland Bridge with a totally new structure. The funding identified will address the eventual replacement of the bridge. Inspections will continue to be required on an annual basis and may generate the need to fund necessary repairs until the total replacement funding is in place. The proposed funding schedule will also allow for the design of replacement plans prior to the availability of total funding.

Rationale

This bridge was originally built as a two lane bridge in 1950 and widened with two additional lanes in 1974. Several of support structures of the original two lane bridge are severely deteriorated to the point that repairs need to be made as soon as possible to avoid a future condition of possible failure. Bridges in Virginia are inspected in accordance with National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The bridge rating criteria rated the Churchland Bridge as a 4. Bridges are rated on a scale from 0-9, with 0 being a failed condition and 9 being excellent. A four rating means the bridge is in poor condition and requires immediate repairs. Further, this rating has mandated that the bridge is inspected once a year as compared to every two years, and a downgrading of the bridge rating would force the City to place load limits on crossing vehicles. A replacement bridge will have a minimum of a 50-year service life.

Funding Strategy

The total project cost, which has been projected out through FY16, is $29.5 million. At this point in time, no other funding sources have been identified. The Engineering Department will continue to research state/federal funding that could be available for this project.

Description and Scope

The Stormwater Management Plan is committed to address lake/pond issues throughout the City. One of these issues is the dredging of the City's lakes and ponds which is necessary to re-establish the original lake depth, remove organic materials and sediment and enhance water quality. The Lake Management Plan prioritizes dredging and other lake improvements based on water quality and increased functionality. The first dredging project commenced in FY08.

Rationale

City street drainage flows into some of the lakes and ponds throughout City. These locations are important to the City's stormwater system,and are included in the city's VPDES Stormwater permit.

Funding Strategy

Starting in FY10, a minimum of $200,000 per year will be budgeted to address lake/pond and outfall dredging. Funding will be used for project design, permits, and maintenance operations after priorities are re-examined based on the updated Lake Management Plan and the Outfall Ditch Rehabilitation Wetlands/Water Assessment Report.

Description and Scope

Compliance with our VPDES Permit is a State and Federal mandate.Project support includes activities that are required to meet that mandate such as water quality monitoring, public education/outreach, inspection of industrial facilities, BMP monitoring, erosion and sediment control program, annual reporting of pollutant loads, TMDL planning and implementation plans, annual reporting of stormwater program activities, etc.

Rationale

We are operating with a State VPDES permit that requires a significant increase in our programmatic efforts,and ensuing costs,to meet the mandates of the permit. It is important to track these efforts and their costs.

Funding Strategy

VPDES permit activities are funded primarily through the Stormwater Utility Fund.

Destination 2025, the City's adopted Comprehensive plan, specifically identifies the City's most important gateways and corridors.Within the adopted Comprehensive Plan, adopted policy statement #10.2(2) calls for improving and investing in the appearance of gateway entrance to and roadway corridors through Portsmouth. These adopted strategies include:investing in visual improvements at interchange entrances and along major roadway corridors;improving the visual appearance of, and reducing visual clutter along roadway corridors, coordinating visual improvements with land use strategies to promote redevlopment; implementing a coordinated program for the installation of attractive/directional information signage throughout Portsmouth that is graphically consistent with the City's marketing program; installing period lighting and historic district signage; maintaining and enhancing existing and creating new view corridors from public ways to scenic resources; and improving the maintenance of right -of-way landscaping and streetscape conditions.

Funding Strategy

$50,000 is programmed each year to maintain the gateways.

Description and Scope

In July 2007, Lincoln Property Company (LPC) was selected as Developer for the six-acre developable site owned by Greater Portsmouth Development Corporation and the Portsmouth Redevelopment and Housing Authority. The Development Agreement for this project was executed on February 14, 2008. An amendment to this agreement was signed on June 12, 2009 granting LPC a year extension due to the downturn in the economy. During this time LPC will work closely with GPDC, PRHA and the City to establish a feasible financing plan for the project and determine the mix of uses for the project. The Olde Towne Holiday Inn has been demolished. The project is projected to have a total development cost of approximately $158 million with $29 million being generated in new tax revenue to the City. It is estimated that there will be a four to five year build-out.

Rationale

Funding Strategy

Partial project costs will be funded through the land sale proceeds from the redevelopment site and remaining project costs will be funded through bond anticipation notes and general obligation bonds.

Description and Scope

Project provides funding for new and upgraded lighting systems to baseball, soccer, football, and softball fields. Fields which will be addressed include:

• Highland Biltmore Softball • Cradock Middle Softball

• Hodges Manor Soccer • Churchland Little League (Field 1)

• Churchland Little League (Field 2)

• Cavalier Manor Football

• Churchland Park Softball #4

Rationale

Enrollment and participation in the City’s athletic leagues is continually increasing. Due to the limited number of fields available for practice and games, it has become necessary for leagues to operate during nighttime hours. In addition, lighting the fields will enhance the leagues ability to host tournaments.

Funding Strategy

This is a long term project to replace and upgrade the City's athletic lighting one field per year.

Operating Budget Impacts

This project allows the City to realize energy savings due to energy efficient bulbs and a 25 year warranty during which time the manufacturer will maintain the lights.

Rationale

In 2006, the City entered into an agreement with the Elizabeth River Project. Under the terms of the agreement, the Elizabeth River Project (ERP) would raise money to purchase land and to design and build a park on Paradise Creek in the Victory Blvd corridor. The City agreed to accept the donation of the park upon completion and operate and maintain the park as a public open space in perpetuity.

Paradise Creek Park is a 40 acre park-in-progress in the heart of a working harbor. This is the cornerstone project of a unique and innovative 250-acre conservation that will benefit businesses, industry, environmental groups and the community.

The park provides the only public access to Paradise Creek, which then connects to the Elizabeth River. The park will also be a model for restoring the larger river and the Chesapeake Bay.

Funding Strategy

Funding is needed in FY 2014 only.

Exterior façade preservation of the buildings located at 601 and 1846 Court Street.

Rationale

The municipal buildings located at 601 Court (The Main Library) and 1846 Court Street (Portsmouth Art & Cultural Center) are both iconic structures in the downtown district. Each has its own architectural uniqueness and appeal. As these are older structures certain maintenance activities are required to preserve the exterior façade. A rehabilitative process will sustain the building as they will continue function in their current capacities.

Description and Scope

Case Management System

Rationale

The Virginia Commonwealth’s Attorney Information System (VCAIS) will be retired by the State in2013. VCAIS was developed by the State for the Commonwealth’s Attorneys use in automation of case management. VCAIS is hosted in Virginia Beach and had been supported with an IT staff of IBM programmers and technicians. The State has been reducing funding for VCAIS over the last several years and the system is now supported by a single programmer (retiring in the near future) on an outdated IBM Lotus Notes/Domino server. Future plans for support and enhancements have been dropped and all Commonwealth Attorneys have been advised to seek a system to replace VCAIS.

Ca

The Portsmouth Commonwealth Attorney has requested the IT Department plan and support the implementation of a new case management system.

This proposed budget recommendation is to implement a prosecute software application to log and track case activities from start to final disposition.

The system would interface with the Police Department’s criminal records system to share case related information. The system will support digital storage of images, audio files and other documents and files associated with the case. Subpoenas can be automated to generate in mass and tracked by service attempts. The proposed automated system is essential to support efficient case processing in the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office.

Description and Scope

Computer Aided Dispatch System

Rationale

The Police Department is requesting the replacement of an aging computer aided dispatching (CAD) system and a crime analysis system to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public safety operations. The current CAD system was purchased in 1994 and lacks many of the features and functionality of a modern automated dispatching support system.

CAD is a critical component of 911 calling taking and dispatching, providing dispatchers with information needed to quickly and effectively respond to an emergency. CAD systems maintain and track information on the caller including a history of prior incidents and alerts at the address; it identifies tracks and recommends available public safety resources and equipment needed to quickly respond to the incident. The current CAD system lacks real-time reporting capabilities and tools for on-line analysis and data query. The existing CAD system does not support integration with advanced automated mapping software to assist in analyzing call trends or identify areas of increased activity. A new CAD system is needed to integrate with the criminal record management system and support crime analysis software tools needed in the Police Department.

A crime mapping and analysis system is being requested to support the rapid assessment and dissemination of critical information to the Police Department. A crime analysis system provides an instant overview or current crime activities in the form of maps, charts and reports accessible with a web browser dashboard. The crime analysis system will interface directly with the CAD and criminal record systems to pull data and consolidate information into a single visual analysis tool. The system use predictive analytics with spatial distribution of crime incidents and historical trends to project future criminal patterns. This system will provide the Police Department with powerful investigative information that can save personnel hours and assist in identifying resource development strategies.

Description and Scope

This project is used to pay for the removal and or disposal of hazardous material such as asbestos, lead, mold and PCB's. Most of the hazardous material has been identified in the City's Asbestos Management Plan. During renovations, some material is exposed that was not identified in the Management Plan. When this occurs, the material must be removed and disposed of properly.

Rationale

This project provides funding to allow for removal of hazardous materials in emergencies as well as planned renovations. The City's Asbestos Management Plan as required by the State, contains language that requires annual funding for both emergency and routine removal of asbestos. This project provides the required funding.

Funding Strategy

This project is funded through GO bonds.

Description and Scope

This project includes the creation of a master plan for the courts with the first phase identified as the construction of a facility which will primarily house the Circuit Court and Clerk of the Court.The Courthouse will have 107,166 gross square feet of space for the Circuit Court,39,837 gross square feet for the General District Court and a minimum of 40,432 gross square feet for Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. The new Judicial Complex will open fall of FY13.

Rationale

The existing civic center presently housing the courts was in serious need of renovation or replacement.

A lawsuit by the Circuit Court judges required the City to move forward with replacement.

Funding Strategy

Operating Budget Impacts

Originally, the City's budgeted five-year plan accepted by the Courthouse developer for FY09 @ $5 million, FY10-12 @ $3 million each, FY13 @

$4.75 million and FY14 @ $9,048,292. In order to settle the pending lawsuit by the Circuit Court judges, the real estate tax rate was increased to establish a courts capital reserve fund. Additional amounts above the funding amounts identified previously will be used to fund all three courts rather than the original plans for the Circuit Court only.

Description and Scope

Revenue System

Rationale

The city Treasurer and Commissioner of Revenue are requesting the replacement of several internally developed taxation and billing systems with a single integrated revenue collections system. The new system will replace several stand alone systems including software applications for business licenses, personal property assessment and taxing, real estate billing, trustee taxes, Virginia income tax processing, animal (dog) licenses, and cashiering and delinquent tax collections. The consolidation of these taxing and billing systems into a single system for the revenue collection will reduce the need to support and maintain separate databases and software applications.

A new integrated revenue and collection system will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of taxing and collection in both the Commissioner of Revenue and City Treasure offices. Staff in these departments must currently work several systems to access and update taxpayer and other related information. An integrated system will reduce staff time to enter and process information by sharing a common taxpayer database across all taxing and billing software applications. The City Treasurer’s office will be able to quickly research a taxpayer’s amounts due in all taxing and billing programs. Delinquent tax collection will become more efficient as liens, Virginia set-off debt collection, stops, judgments and other collection activities can occur over several systems at one time. Time saved by the staff can be used to enhance revenue collection and improve customer service.

The new system will also include citizen and business web portals. Citizens will be able to access more information regarding their accounts to determine the status of the account, amounts and dates due. A payment web portal will interface with the system to allow for convenient payment options. A business web site will be provided for business license renewals, trustee tax submissions and business personal property submissions and payments. These new online services will provide options for business to report and renew licenses without visiting City Hall.

Description and Scope

This project provides funding for necessary repairs/replacement of the waterfront seawall from Swimming Point parallel to Crawford Pkwy east to the former Holiday Inn site and from the North end on the Elizabeth River side to teh south end of the seawall adjacent to City Hall.

The first phase was the replacement of approximately 140 feet of this seawall that collapsed just north of High Street Landing. The second phase was replacement of the seawall from Swimming Point to the Holiday Inn site parallel to Crawford Parkway. The third phase will be replacement of the seawall on the Elizabeth River side from the North Landing, north to the Tidewater Yacht Marina, a length of approximately 800 feet.

Rationale

The Seawall is a major city-owned asset in downtown Portsmouth. The impacts of the seawall on economic development, tourism, and community pride are difficult to quantify, but are significant. Recent routine inspections of the seawall have shown that there is substantial damage that must be repaired.

The design is complete for seawall repair work from North Landing up to the northen end of the Seawall. Inspections have been completed for the Seawall located north of North Landing. Substanital funding was provided in FY 13to address this major repair.

Funding Strategy

This project is expected to be cash funded in FY 2015.

Operating Budget Impacts

No impact to the operating budget.

Description and Scope

This project provides funding for the replacement of County Street Parking Garage. Current inspections and the immediate need for major structural repairs serve to confirm the necessity to plan for this facility's replacement. To maintain the garage in full operation additional repairs will be necessary prior to replacement funding.

Rationale

The County Street Parking Garage was built in 1969 and is reaching the end of its useful service life. Numerous pre-cast structural elements are facing deterioration and require extensive repairs or replacement, which has limited the use of portions of the structure. The condition of the most recent structural elements needing to be replaced have resulted in extensive repairs and the closing the top deck of the garage. Replacing this garage will allow the City to continue providing adequate numbers of parking spaces in this high parking demand area of Downtown, and address a safety issue for all users.

Funding Strategy

Additional funding in support of this project is programmed in FY 2015 and FY 2016, and expected to be debt financed.

Description and Scope

Ongoing capital funds are needed to make rehabilitation repairs to the nine City parking garages. Funding over the next five years will be used to address structural concerns in the Central Garage and painting in the Water Street Garage.

Rationale

The parking garages are major structures that often require one-time, major repairs/upgrades that are beyond the scope of the annual operating budget funds. As such, an ongoing CIP account has been created to fund these major repairs.

Funding Strategy

Funding for this project has been budgeted at $225,000 in FY 2014, increasing to $250,000 for both FY 2015 and FY 2016. These amounts are expected to be cash funded.

Operating Budget Impacts

Maintaining the garages properly prevents escalating maintenance costs.
