• Proposed Budget Uses of Fund Balance $4.5 million to Cash fund CIP

$1.2 million to balance the GF Budget

14



General Fund Unassigned Fund Balance

• We recommend no further drawdown of fund balance for the following reasons:

– Bond rating agencies warning, potential impact on credit rating

– Unknown impacts from Sequestration

– Known cost increases coming for FY 2015 and 2016

– Economic recovery remains uncertain 15



City Contribution to

Portsmouth Public Schools

• Budget continues City Council goal of maintaining a high quality School system

• Proposed budget provides local funding to Schools of $46 million

• Reduction of $7.8 million

• We have analyzed School expenditures for the past several years as reported in their Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs)

16



City Contribution to

Portsmouth Public Schools

• City and School staffs have identified several opportunities to partner and save money:

– Combine health insurance coverage and plan management with City and change to self-insured program - $3.3 million annually

– Have City assume responsibility for School fleet management - $0.1 million annually

– Combine certain Finance functions such as purchasing and payroll - $0.1 million annually 17



City Contribution to

Portsmouth Public Schools

• Based on prior year expenditures and savings from these partnerships, we believe that $46 million in City support of School operations will provide adequate funding

• Recommend that Council make the FY 2014

School appropriation by category

• School Superintendent has said that he expects to return at least $3.4 million to the City at the close of FY 2013.

We included this amount as revenues in FY 2014
