BALANCING THE BUDGET



Due to limited growth in revenues from real estate assessments and anticipated State revenue cuts, the opportunity was taken to review ways in which to reduce expenditures and generate savings in this budget. The budget balancing measures total $9.3 million and include: removing attrition from departmental budgets ($1.0M); eliminating 16 permanent full-time positions and several part-time positions ($1.3M); reduction in average merit increase given to employees ($819,000); reducing contingency ($225,000); departmental operating costs reductions ($658,679); deferring capital projects ($1.1M); using fund balance ($4.0M) for capital projects and one-time items and reducing contributions to non-contractual civic and community support agencies ($186,877).





EDUCATION EXPENDITURES



The total school budget for FY 2009 is $215,880,242, a 5.22% increase over FY 2008.

The total local contribution to the Hampton School System is $69,216,564, a 4.06%

increase over FY 2008. The required local contribution, according to state law, is $32,732,015. The City’s contribution in excess of the state requirement is $36,484,549.

The local contribution to the schools is based on a mutually agreed upon formula in which they will receive a predetermined percentage of residential general property and utility tax revenues. Further, the local contribution to Schools is based on a $1.06 real estate tax rate as opposed to the actual finale rate of $1.04. This represents nearly $1.0

million more than required by the local funding formula.
