General Overview



What is a Capital Improvement Plan? A Project?



The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is a five-year expenditure plan to finance the acquisition of property and

equipment and to fund new construction and other major improvements to existing public facilities. Each locality establishes its own criteria for capital projects. The City of Hampton‟s criterion for a capital project is that it must have a cost in excess of $50,000 and a life expectancy of at least five years.



Objectives of the Capital Improvement Plan



The objectives of the Capital Improvement Plan serve to:



 Execute projects that support the City of Hampton‟s Community Plan and sustain Hampton‟s vision of making

our community the “most livable community in Virginia.” The Hampton Community Plan can be accessed on the

internet at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under the “Community Plan” section.



 Prepare the Capital Budget component of the Manager‟s Recommended Budget, which will subsequently become the Council Approved Budget. The CIP serves as one of many planning tools used during the budget

development process.



 Protect the City‟s bond rating by ensuring that conservative fiscal parameters are exercised when scheduling and implementing projects.



 Balance the City‟s need for new and/or enhanced economic development with existing development and capital

renewal needs.



 Address and implement critical initiatives outlined in the Council Approved Strategic Area Master Plans which can be accessed on the internet at www.hampton.gov/community-plan/ under the “Strategic Master Plans”

section.



 Merge the Hampton City Schools‟ capital improvement plans with the City‟s process.



Development Process



The annual development process commences with reviewing and analyzing submitted funding requests.

Suggested funding requests come from a variety of sources such as City departments, City Council, citizen groups and local business communities (referred to as business improvement districts [BIDs] in the City of Hampton). It is recommended that project submissions from citizen groups and BIDs be submitted through and advocated by a City department to ensure the required due diligence is performed (i.e. feasibility study and cost analysis). At the conclusion of the review process, the CIP Committee meetings commence.

The CIP Committee is comprised of Assistant City Managers, Director of the Office of Budget and Management

Analysis, Director of Economic Development, Director of Finance, Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Debt Manager, a Hampton City Schools‟ representative and the CIP Coordinator. Over several months, the CIP Committee takes the steps listed below, in general terms, to develop a proposed plan.



Ensure the relevancy of the current year‟s projects in light of any recent developments and adjust where

necessary.

Development Process (Cont’d)



Review and categorize all new requests into one of the ten expenditure categories which are then ranked based on an established set of criteria (i.e. legal requirements; investments in maintaining current assets; strategic investments; implementation of Community Plan and expansion of current

service delivery).



Review the list of previously submitted unfunded projects to determine their relevancy and if any can now be considered for funding.



Review and confirm various revenue sources available.



Community educational forums and „citizen chats‟ are also held during the CIP development process and prior to any public hearings. These events provide the community with an opportunity to learn about the process and communicate their priorities, values and concerns for various project areas. The feedback received from the community is weighed during the CIP development process.



Once the CIP Committee has reached a consensus on a proposed Plan, yearly revenue and expenditure schedules are developed for each project. The Committee also determines whether the proposed Plan is in compliance with the City‟s Council Approved Financial Policies as it relates to debt capacity and affordability. The proposed Plan is presented to the public and each of the governing bodies (Planning Commission and the City Council) at their respective public hearings. Only the City Council has the authority to approve a balanced five-year Plan, either “as presented” or

“with modifications.” This action occurs prior to the April 15th submission of the Manager‟s Recommended Budget to the City Council. The first year of the approved five-year plan is then incorporated in the Manager‟s Recommended Budget as the Capital Budget component. The remaining years of the five-year plan are referenced to as “planned years.” At the beginning of each planning cycle, one year is added so that the plan remains a “five-year” plan.



Revenue Sources



Each project is funded by one or more revenue source. Revenues that the City of Hampton utilizes come from

several sources and are generally grouped into one of the following four categories: federal and state government revenues, General Obligation Bond Proceeds, dedicated taxes and fees and contributions from the General Fund.

Federal and State Government revenues are typically one-time and dedicated for specific types of projects such as street and road improvements. On occasion, a cash match may be required from the City.



General Obligation Bond Proceeds are revenues received from municipal bonds which are used to fund major one-time-only capital expenditures and limits the amount of public funds designated for new projects/construction. The level of debt that the City of Hampton can incur is governed by the Council approved Financial Policies.



Dedicated Taxes and Fees are revenues received from certain taxes and fees, as well as land sales, to fund specific projects.



Contributions from the General Fund, which is the City‟s major Fund used to account for all financial resources not accounted for in any other Fund, generally support maintenance-type projects and one-time-only capital expenditures.

Expenditure Categories





Each capital improvement project falls into one of the following ten broad expenditure categories depending upon the nature of the project. Brief descriptions of these categories are listed below.



1. The Education project category includes funding to support site improvements at Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) and assist Hampton City Schools with routine maintenance and various renovation projects.



2. The Hampton’s Waterways project category includes improvements to and maintenance of the various waterways located in the City.



3. The Maintenance of Public Properties and Performance Support project category includes maintenance and/or major improvements, including construction, to existing public facilities and properties.



4. The Master Plans project category includes projects that implement the Community Plan through various strategic investments.

5. The Neighborhood Support project category includes projects that improve the quality of neighborhoods through the acquisition and demolition of blighted properties and the grant-matched neighborhood improvement

program.



6. The New Facilities project category encompasses construction projects for all new public facilities.



7. The Other CIP Projects category includes projects that do not fit within the other expenditure categories such as “Contingency,” which covers cost overruns for previously approved General Fund capital projects.



8. The Other Economic Development Support project category includes projects that provide indirect aid and support to improve/increase the City‟s economic base.



9. The Public Safety project category includes items specific to service delivery of the City‟s public safety departments.



10. The Streets and Infrastructure project category includes resurfacing and maintenance of streets, roads and sidewalks. A tentative street resurfacing plan is developed annually by the City‟s Department of Public Works

and is published on their website at www.hampton.gov/publicworks under the “What’s New” section.
