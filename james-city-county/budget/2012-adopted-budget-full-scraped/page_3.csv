representative government in America. We are a community that preserves and protects its irreplaceable
assets for current and future generations and for visitors from around the world.
We value healthy minds and healthy bodies. James City County is a community that values and
supports a high-performance education system for its children and adults as well as lifelong learning
opportunities for all.  We have easy access to a range of quality health care and a quality park and
recreation system and leisure opportunities to promote wellness.
"We have a special character. James City County is known for its beauty as reflected in open spaces,"
vistas and the health of its ecosystems. We have a sense of community because there is a range of quality
housing that is thoughtfully and logically placed and developed with sustainability in mind. Our
"community feels safe in its neighborhoods, which are attractive, pleasant and welcoming places to live."
Business and industry add to our character and want to locate and grow here. We are economically
"strong with a stable tax base and meaningful jobs. We have a safe, efficient multi modal transportation"
network that is interconnected with the rest of Hampton Roads and Virginia.
We are a community of choice. James City County is the County of choice for people of many income
"levels, cultures and ethnicities."
We have first-class government. James City County Government focuses on the needs of the
community by fostering citizen participation and involvement in local government. By maintaining a
"well-trained, professional and ethical staff, we continually strive to make James City County the best"
