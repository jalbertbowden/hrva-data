Special Projects/Grants Fund
"The Department of Development Management, through the Engineering and Resource Protection Division,"
will administer a watershed management study for the tributaries in the County that flow to the York River.
General Services and its Stormwater Division will begin work on a stream restoration project in Mill Creek
and on drainage improvements in the James Terrace subdivision.
A pilot program is being proposed that creates a small grant program for homeowners and businesses that
would allow them to install landscaping features to redirect stormwater or to raise outdoor heat pump units.
The program is directed at property owners with improvements that have experienced repeated damage due
to flooding during storms.
This fund also includes one part-time position with benefits for the Commonwealth Attorney’s office.
Renewal of this grant is expected and the actual grant appropriations are submitted when the grants are
awarded.
